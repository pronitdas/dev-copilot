# Engineering Fundamentals: Build Fast, Scale Smart

*High-leverage patterns that maximize output while minimizing maintenance costs*

## Core Principles

### DRY: Extract Maximum Leverage
- **Internal Libraries**: Package reusable logic into versioned modules that can be imported across services
- **Bounded Contexts**: Define clear domain boundaries to prevent leaky abstractions
- **Contract Testing**: Ensure interfaces between components remain stable as implementations evolve
- **Code Generation**: Use templating/scaffolding for repetitive structures (routes, models, CRUD)
- **Automate Everything**: If you've done it twice manually, automate it the third time

### SOLID: Engineer for Resilience
- **Single Responsibility**: Services should do one thing extremely well
- **Open/Closed**: Add capabilities through extension, not modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Components should be hot-swappable with zero downstream impact
- **Interface Segregation**: Keep interfaces thin and focused - better 5 small interfaces than 1 large one
- **Dependency Injection**: Wire dependencies at runtime for maximum flexibility and testability

### 12-Factor: Cloud-Native By Default

| Factor | Implementation | Benefit |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| **Codebase** | One repo per service with clear ownership | Eliminates merge conflicts, enables independent scaling |
| **Dependencies** | Explicit declarations, no system-level dependencies | Reproducible builds, consistent environments |
| **Config** | Environment variables with strong typing and validation | No config in code, easy environment switching |
| **Backing Services** | Treat all external services as attached resources | Seamless local dev, staging, and production |
| **Build/Release/Run** | CI/CD pipeline with immutable artifacts | Predictable deployments, fast rollbacks |
| **Processes** | Stateless design with external persistence | Horizontal scaling, elastic infrastructure |
| **Port Binding** | Self-contained services with HTTP interfaces | Microservice architecture, clear boundaries |
| **Concurrency** | Scale via process model, not threading | Simple mental model, predictable resource usage |
| **Disposability** | Fast startup, graceful shutdown with connection draining | Zero-downtime deployments, auto-scaling |
| **Dev/Prod Parity** | Container-based development with matching dependencies | "Works on my machine" becomes "works everywhere" |
| **Logs** | Structured JSON to stdout/stderr | Searchable, aggregatable, machine-readable |
| **Admin Tasks** | One-off scripts packaged with application code | Reproducible maintenance operations |

## Infrastructure Standards

### Kubernetes-Ready Architecture
- **Stateless Core**: Keep state in purpose-built stores (Postgres, Redis, S3)
- **Health Checks**: Implement `/health` and `/ready` endpoints on all services
- **Configuration**: Use ConfigMaps for app config, Secrets for credentials
- **Resource Limits**: Explicitly set CPU/memory requirements
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Catch SIGTERM and clean up connections

### Observability Stack
- **Metrics**: Instrument all services with Prometheus metrics
- **Logs**: Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs across services
- **Traces**: OpenTelemetry for request flows across service boundaries
- **Alerts**: Define SLOs and alert on them, not on raw metrics
- **Dashboards**: Create per-service dashboards with the 4 golden signals:
  - Latency: How long to respond?
  - Traffic: How many requests/second?
  - Errors: What percentage are failing?
  - Saturation: How full is your service?

## Security & Compliance

### HIPAA Compliance
- **Data Encryption**: TLS 1.3+ in transit, AES-256 at rest
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions with principle of least privilege
- **Audit Logging**: Record all PHI access with who/what/when/why
- **Data Segmentation**: Isolate PHI in dedicated storage
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular testing of backup/restore procedures
- **BAAs**: Business Associate Agreements with all vendors
- **Incident Response**: Documented procedures for potential breaches

### PCI-DSS Requirements
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate payment processing from other systems
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Tokenization over storage when possible
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular automated scanning of all components
- **Penetration Testing**: Annual third-party security assessment
- **Patch Management**: Clear process for security updates
- **Minimal Surface Area**: Remove unnecessary services and dependencies

## Development Workflow

### Version Control Hygiene
- **Trunk-Based Development**: Short-lived feature branches, merge to main daily
- **PR Templates**: Standardized PR format with risk assessment
- **Semantic Versioning**: Follow semver strictly for all libraries
- **Commit Conventions**: `type(scope): message` format (e.g., `feat(auth): add MFA support`)
- **Branch Protection**: Require reviews and passing CI for all PRs

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Fast, focused, testing business logic in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Validate service interactions with real dependencies
- **Contract Tests**: Ensure API compatibility between producer/consumer
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarks with clear pass/fail criteria
- **Chaos Testing**: Regular disruption of services to ensure resilience

### CI/CD Pipeline Requirements
- **Fast Feedback**: <10 minute cycle from commit to deployment readiness
- **Zero-Touch Deployment**: Fully automated with progressive rollout
- **Feature Flags**: Decouple deployment from release
- **Artifact Promotion**: Build once, deploy many times
- **Ephemeral Environments**: On-demand test environments for feature validation

## Technical Debt Management

### Refactoring Strategy
- **Boy Scout Rule**: Leave code better than you found it
- **Tech Debt Backlog**: Maintain prioritized list of improvement opportunities
- **Refactoring Cadence**: Dedicate 20% of capacity to system improvement
- **Deprecation Policy**: Clear timelines for sunsetting old APIs/services
- **Metric-Driven**: Focus efforts on high-maintenance areas (error rates, time to deploy)

## Performance Optimization

### Database Efficiency
- **Query Optimization**: Profile and tune slow queries
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections, avoid per-request setup
- **Index Strategy**: Create indexes based on access patterns
- **Caching Layer**: Add Redis for frequently accessed data
- **Partitioning**: Horizontal splitting for large tables

### Frontend Performance
- **Bundle Size**: <200KB initial JS load
- **Time to Interactive**: <3 seconds on mid-tier mobile
- **Lazy Loading**: Split code by route, defer non-critical resources
- **Performance Budget**: Set clear limits for key metrics
- **CDN Strategy**: Edge caching for static assets

## Architecture Decision Records

Maintain a collection of ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) that document:

1. Context and problem statement
2. Decision drivers and constraints
3. Options considered
4. Decision outcome and consequences
5. Validation criteria

## Final Principles

1. **Optimize for Deletion**: The best code is code you can completely replace in a week
2. **Design for Operations**: Build with monitoring, debugging, and maintenance in mind
3. **Data > Opinions**: Make decisions based on metrics, not hunches
4. **Automate Toil**: If it's repetitive, script it
5. **Embrace Simplicity**: Complex solutions compound maintenance costs

Remember: Speed of iteration beats perfection of implementation. Build modular systems that can evolve component by component without requiring complete rewrites.
